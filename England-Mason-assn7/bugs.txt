insertion sort 

is clearly sorting the cards by suit and not by rank

for this part the main solutions is to change where it says "suite" to "rank"
in any spots applicable

selection sort

clearly not correct 
starting it tries to use the j variable when it is clearly out of scope 
changing this to i fixed the issue

the for loop also tried to access members of the list using the i index instead of
the j index which meant it was retrieveing and comparing the wrong elements
I changed the i to j here and it fixed the issue 

bubble sort 

the for loop was iterating by the length of the list - number of operations done 
this made the sort end too early. instead you only need to subtract 1 from the 
length of this list so tha the index doesn't go out of range

linear search 

all I could find was that the function was comparing and id to the card object 
I fixed this by adding the get_id() method call 
coudn't find many bugs but it works fine now

binary search 

program was entering into an infinite loop 
found that the alorithm was setting mid to a new number instead of low and high 
this meant that since low and high were never changing the while condition would never be met
and thus the program would soft lock

both comparative operations also neede to be switched after the elif statements
