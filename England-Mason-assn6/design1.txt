grid implementation


make a cell size which will be 10

grid sieze needs to be == to SCREEN_WIDTH // cell_size 

Cell:

    - draw_pos: list[2]
    - screen: Surface
    - image: Surface
    - active: bool
    - width: int 
    - heigt: int
--------------------------
    + draw(): None 
    + activate(player: Player, image: Surface, corner image: Surface): None
    + did_hit(player): Null | String

the draw() function will have the cell draw itself assuming its active, otherwise it needs not draw nothing 

the activate function means to activat the cell so that it draws itself, also will deterimine the image 
did_hit takes a player as a paramter and determines if the player is over an active cell, and if so returns the players color 

Player:

    - draw_pos: list[2]
    - screen: Surface
    - draw_factor: int # to keep player on the grid
    - velocity: list[2]
    - image: Surface
    - color: String 

--------------------------
    + draw(): None
    + move(): None
    + get_pos(): list[2]
    + did_hit_wall(dimensions: list): bool

draw() draws the player to the screen
get_pos() will allow the cells and main sections to get the players position 
move() will work by ading the players velocity to the players position 
move() will also read the keyboard 
did_hit_wall() will take the dimesnsion of the screen and check 
if the player has gone beyond the bounds of the 
screen and returns True or False based on the results

setup:  
    start with the initial setup and loading all steps 

    make a 2 dimensional array to make a game grid that covers the whole screen
    will make it by using two for loops to create a list of lists 

game loop:
    check for quit event 

    iterate through all cells in the game grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in grid[i]:
            call methods attached to individual cells 
            check player/cell collisions
    
    iterate through players to call methods attached to players 
    check player-wall collisions

    if game_over:
        display game_over screen
        player game over music 

    flip diplay 
    tick the clock
