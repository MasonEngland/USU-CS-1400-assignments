### Description 

this is a repository containg all of the assignments from utah state's intro to computer science course(CS 1400)
the course had 7 main chapters with 1-2 assignments each. this is mainly here so I can keep track of all code I have
written for the sake of self reflection and improvment


### **DISCLAIMER!!!**

I do not approve of any students coming to this page to have me do their work for them.
let it be known that the course changes often and many of the assignments in this repo are likley changed 
or completely different from my version. not to mention I did not get full points on all of these assignments 
so copy at your own risk. I have no issue with students looking at my code to find possible help or solutions
to similar problems in their assignments but I do not condone copying any of my code.
