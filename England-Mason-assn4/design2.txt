There is a lot of starter code to work with so I will have to mostly worry about the patterns


rectangle_pattern(x, y, offset, width, height, count, rotation):
    base_angle = 360 / count

    for i in range(count):
        coords = get_distance_point(offset, base_angle * i) # hopefully this will spread the rectangles evenly
        rectangle(coords[0], coords[1], width, height rotation= rotation)
        draw()

circle_patter(x, y, radius, offset, count): #this should be much simpler
    base_angle = 360 / count 

    for i in range(count):
        coords = get_distance_point(radius + offset, base_angle * i) # same as last pattern
        circle(coords[0], coords[1], radius)
        draw()
    
draw_super_patter(num):
    for i in range(num):
        maybe get a random number of 0 or 1

        maybe draw circle or rectangle based on this

        draw_rectangle(pass in all randint values for both functions)
